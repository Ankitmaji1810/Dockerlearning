Hi All, this is not my code. This is a sample code for a Node application, where react is used as FE and Mongo is used as DB.

So that you know, I have created the docker file and docker compose file only.

commands
check if docker is installed in your system
docker --version

if not please find instructions here - https://docs.docker.com/desktop/

now just run
"docker compose up -d"

go to localhost:3000
